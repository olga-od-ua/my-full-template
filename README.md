# The Gift Of The Gab

[Live project can be viewed here](https://olga-od-ua.github.io/CCC-MS1-2020---master)    <<<<!!!!!!!!to change!!!!!!!!!>>>>

The Primary goal of the website is represent and promote The Gift Of The Gab School that offers English language courses to anyone travelling to Ireland whether for a holiday or a lifetime. 

Irish accents are notorious for being hard to understand even for some native English speakers so this school is aiming to help their every customer feel comfortable in any conversation with an Irish person.

The website will provide all the basic information about the school's offers, its team, prices and contact information. Apart from the General English Course the school also offers Business English Course and Hospitality English Course. There are also Intensive Course plans available. The website offers a knowledge test that any user can take to understand their level of competency. Users will be able to print the test results and/or send them to their email address.

UX PROCESS

**The Strategy Plane**

THE RESEARCH PHASE

Ireland is a country that has welcomed many different nationalities over the past many years and continues to do so, whether it is for business, educational or personal needs, whether for a short- or long-term stay or for a permanent settlement. According to the latest census, there are over half a million non-irish nationals among almost 5,000,000 people living in Iriland. "In April 2016, there were 535,475 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland, a 1.6 per cent decrease on the 2011 figure (544,357). The proportion of the population who were non-Irish nationals has also fallen from 12.2 per cent in 2011 to 11.6 per cent in 2016. This fall in non-Irish nationals can in part be explained by the rise in the number of those with dual Irish nationality, who are classified as Irish in the [census](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp7md/p7md/p7anii/)."

As English is the main language in the bigger part of The Republic of Ireland, practically all the non-irish nationals residing in Ireland are expected to know the language on a fluent level. After conducting a survey we have found out that before arriving in Ireland the non-English speakers would have learnt English at schools or have taken courses in their countries. The survey showed that they were arriving in different areas in the Republic and almost equally found it very difficult to understand local accents and dialects, as well as slang which differs greatly from county to county and at times even from town to town.

1. The primary goal. 
The Gift Of The Gab Enlish courses are designed to help those moving to Ireland make their language adaptation journey smooth and enjoyable. The Gift Of The Gab teachers are extremely knowledgeable about all the traps and obstacles the students can expect once they land their feet on the Irish soil, whether those traps and obstacles are linguistic or cultural.

2. The website will present all the basic information about the school and will have a few interactive features, i.e. the knowledge test, contact form, school brunches location on Google maps, print options and more. In future releases the school is planning to make studying materials available on the website as well as the online booking of classes.

3. The business objectives of the website are set to attract new customers and promote The Gift Of The Gab School.

4. The customer's estimated needs are to get a quick and easy information about what The Gift Of The Gab School has to offer and how/whether it can help them reach their goals. For those interested in their level of English language knowledge, the quick knowledge test will help get the result free of charge. A quick questionnaire will also help users with the choice of the course and its intensity. Businesses can also request their customised offer through the website.

HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

While there is a plethora of English language courses available in Ireland, neither of them are aiming at teaching specific accents nor helping their customers to integrate culturally. The Gift Of The Gab school knows how important it is to feel comfortable when speaaking a foreign language, let alone when your interlocutor speaks with a strong accent and/or uses a lot of local slang. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Our project is aimed at offering a credible, trustworthy website with intuitive experience for the user. The users' main questions will be answered upon the first landing on the Home page, mainly:
- learn about history of coffee ("History" page)
- find the information about different coffee flavours depending on their origin ("Map Of Flavours" page)
- learn about different ways of coffee making and explore recipes ("Perfect Cup" page)
- join the Cork Coffee Club ("Cork Coffee Club" page)
- links to the websites of the partners and sponsors, social media pages as well as contact details will be available in the footer.

**The Scope Plane**

The website is planned to have three main releases as identified in the folowing table https://imgur.com/a/8lddGoE in order to unfold new experiences for the users. In order to consistently surprise and delight the customers, flash sales and competitions will be implemented in the future.

This website will become the building block for the coffee community, becoming their one-stop coffee shop, where true coffee fans will find like-minded friends and connections. Users will have the ability to find useful information about coffee origins and how the geographic location influences coffee beans flavour allowing users to learn where their favourite flavour comes from and open up a world of further exploration of their regions of choice. Users will have access to the library of video tutorials on coffee making, recipes and coffee art from experts.

This project is currently aiming at gathering social media followers and building a strong Community for coffee enthusiasts. I am passionate about local businesses and enterprise therefore I am dedicating my website to Cork local coffee roasters and sellers who in return may agree to become sponsors and partners in creating memorable coffee experiences for our Community, such as various coffee events, competitions, lessons. In the future I am aiming to have various local coffee brands in one online shop where not only coffee products will be available but also merchandise, gift cards, coffee kits and wholesale options. 

This website can be sellable as it will have a clientele needed for coffee business needs.

**The Structure Plane**

The website has the nav bar that will feature five linear menu elements representing the five main sections of the coffee project, namely:
- Home
- History 
- Map of Flavors 
- Perfect Cup
- Cork Coffee Club

The footer will appear on each of the tabs and will have the following information to hand:
- Partners and Sponsors 
- Social networks 
- Contact details  
- Copyright 
	
Home page will briefly introduce the content of all the other website pages with the links to them in order to create a more intuitive experience for the user.

In the PC version, the navigation is represented by the Nav bar with inline elements. In future releases the nav bar items will have room for subcategories. In the mobile version the navigation will be represented by the Burger Icon. In the future releases the burger icon will have room for additional layers.

## Testing

The following tests were performed:
- Website appears to work well in other browsers (i.e Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

The following test conclusions were made:
1. All links are working as intended:
    - the logo on the top left brings the user back to the Home page.
    - the links in the main content on the Home page bring the user to the correct pages (i. e. "history of coffee" to "History" page, "coffee flavour" to "Map Of Flavours" page, "recipes and tutorials" to "Perfect Cup" page, "join the Cork Coffee Club" to "Cork Coffee Club" page).
    - the Bean Belt image on the Map Of Flavours page brings the user to the image source and opens in a new tab.
    - all the videos on the Home page and Perfect Cup page open in YouTube in a new tab when clicked.
    - video on the Home page auto plays and is muted.
    - partners and sponsors logos in the footer are linked to the official websites of those companies and open in a new tab.
    - social media links open their official websites and open in a new tab.
2. Sign Up form. Steps taken to test:
    - Go to the "Cork Coffee Club" page
    - Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    - Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    - Try to submit the form with a valid email address but without making a selection on the radio buttons and verify that a relevant error message appears
    - Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
3. Hover over effect works in the following elements with all screen sizes:
    - Nav bar (menu items).
    - White text on the Home and History pages.
    - Sign up button on the Cork Coffee Club page.
4.  Video on the home page autoplays and is muted.
5. Map Of Flavours page.
    - Text about coffee flavours appears above the image as the screen gets smaller, as the text on the image would not be readable otherwise.
6. Burger menu replaces the nav bar as the screen gets smaller.
7. The Pop-up Nav bar for mobile-sized devices is intentionally sticking out on the right-hand side to prompt users to peak inside there to discover more and trigger further steps.

BUGS

Cork Coffee Club page. The form does not allow any input, the radio buttons and the sign-up button do not respond to any action. The bug was fixed by splitting the main content into two separate sections: one with the four text columns and the other with the form itself.

Another existing bug: the nav pop-up window from the burger menu partially covers its "close window" icon on some mobile devices.

## Deployment

The project had to be rewritten from scratch in order to allow more frequent commits. More frequents commits will be ensured for future releases.
